# State Table and Flight Plan

## Mission requirements

1. flight computer powers, wait for 15 seconds for both boards to power on and boot
2. next 15 seconds establish connection between the boards, during first 30 seconds.
3. long beep after 30 seconds
4. get altitude reference , and calibrate IMU
5. continuity check should be done on ejection charges , every 300-400 loop cycles
6. When idle , arduino starts sending all sensor data to raspi , and arduino to telemetery , also keeps checking altitude from BMP and inegrating the IMU acceleration to see if we have entered flight mode
7. enter flight mode if altitude higher than 200m. , 
    in flight mode apogee is detected either when bmp velocity is 0 or
    - case 1 - IMU detects tip over
    - case 2- if IMU says tip over not detected
        - bmp and IMU velocity match at instant
        - when vel is small ( i.e 5m/s ) - deploy parachute
        - wait for vel to decrease if vel is high for parachute to deploy
        - WIP
    - keep the data in buffer 
8. deploy drouge after apogge is detected
9. deploy parachute when vel is small
10. enter descent mode after parachute deployed , keep sending sensor readings, turn on gps , send gps vel position data too.
11. if altitude is less than 20m  or velocity is <1m/s for 10 seconds (building or tree height) enter recovery mode
12. in recovery mode ,gps and keep sending location coordinates via telemetry.

## States

1. Boot
2. Connect - Establish Connection between arduino and raspi
3. Calibrate - calibrate IMU , get ref altitude from BMP
4. Idle - send data , watch for flight mode
5. Flight mode - keep track of imu vel and bmp vel and imu tipover to detect apogee, enter drouge state.
6. drouge state - deoply drouge, keep waiting for vel / altitute to decrease to enter parachute state
7. parachute state - deoply parachute , keep sending data, check for vel and altitude to enter recovery mode
8. recovery mode - keep sending location data via telemetry , and turn on buzzer , beep.

## Data

- all data is send to raspi while idle and descent(drouge/parachute) mode
- while flight mode , data is kept in buffer , send afterwards.
- recovery mode , only location, altitude is sent.
